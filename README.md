# Docker PHP Tutorial - Learning Docker for PHP Developers
In this tutorial I'll take you on "my" journey of learning Docker as a PHP developer. 
Since I actively use everything explained along the way (and force it upon my team ;)) I can hopefully
shed some light onto some more advanced issues like cross-OS-setups and seamless IDE integration.

Two words of caution:
- I tend to write rather lengthy, in-dept articles so you should allocate some time to work it all
through
- my main OS is Windows. Although most of the things should be easily transferable into OSX/Linux you might run into
  some quirks that I didn't encounter.

## Setup
Each tutorial is placed in a separate branch and has an accompanying article in [my blog](https://www.pascallandau.com/blog/)
I recommend to clone the full repository and check out the corresponding branch for easy reference. Example:

````
mkdir -p /c/codebase
cd /c/codebase/
git clone https://github.com/yaowenqiang/docker-php-tutorial.git
cd docker-php-tutorial

git fetch origin
git checkout part_2_setting-up-phpstorm-with-xdebug-for-local-development-on-docker

````

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/PascalLandau) about it ;)
